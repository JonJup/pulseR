\title{Determine Core Regions from Fuzzy Membership Degrees}
\usage{
get_core_regions(x, membership_cols = NULL, cutoff = 0.5, queen = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An sf object containing polygons with fuzzy membership degrees.}

\item{membership_cols}{A character vector of column names containing the
membership degrees for each class. If NULL, all numeric columns except
geometry are used.}

\item{cutoff}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the minimum
membership degree threshold for core region inclusion. Default is 0.5.}

\item{queen}{Logical. If TRUE (default), uses queen contiguity (polygons
sharing edges or vertices are considered neighbors). If FALSE, uses rook
contiguity (only shared edges).}
}
\value{
A named list where each element corresponds to a class (named by
the membership column). Each element is an sf object containing the core
region polygons for that class, with an additional column 'core_region_id'
identifying distinct contiguous regions.
}
\description{
This function identifies core regions for each class based on fuzzy membership
degrees. Core regions are defined as contiguous groups of polygons where the
membership degree meets or exceeds a specified threshold.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps for each class:
\enumerate{
\item Filters polygons where membership degree >= cutoff
\item Builds a spatial adjacency graph
\item Identifies connected components (contiguous regions)
\item Returns polygons with their core region assignment
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming 'fuzzy_data' is an sf object with membership columns
core_regions <- get_core_regions(
  x = fuzzy_data,
  membership_cols = c("class_A", "class_B", "class_C"),
  cutoff = 0.6
)

# Access core regions for class_A
core_regions$class_A
}
