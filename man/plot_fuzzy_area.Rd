\title{Visualize Fuzzy Classification of Geographic Areas}
\usage{
plot_fuzzy_area(polygons, fuzzy_memberships, plot = NULL, auto_rename = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{polygons}{An \code{sf} object representing the geographic areas (e.g., river segments, catchments).
Must contain a geometry column.}

\item{fuzzy_memberships}{A matrix or data frame containing the membership probabilities for each class.
Rows must correspond to the rows in \code{polygons}.}

\item{plot}{Character string. Specifies the type of plot to generate. Options are:
\describe{
\item{\code{"RGB"}}{Maps the first three classes to Red, Green, and Blue channels. Requires exactly 3 classes.}
\item{\code{"ternary1"}}{Produces a standard ternary plot of the data points (non-spatial).}
\item{\code{"ternary2"}}{Produces a choropleth map with a ternary color scale legend (requires \code{tricolore}).}
\item{\code{"small multiples"}}{Facets the map by class, showing probability intensity for each class separately.}
\item{\code{"dominant"}}{Maps the class with the highest probability, with transparency scaled by the certainty (max probability).}
}}

\item{auto_rename}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), renames the columns of \code{fuzzy_memberships} to
"class1", "class2", ..., "classN". If \code{FALSE}, existing column names are preserved.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object (or a cowplot object for "ternary2").
}
\description{
This function visualizes fuzzy classification memberships over a set of geographic polygons.
It supports multiple visualization methods, including RGB mapping, ternary plots,
small multiples, and dominant class maps modulated by uncertainty.
}
\details{
\strong{Plot Types:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{RGB:} Useful for visualizing the transition zones between exactly three distinct types.
\item \strong{Ternary:} "ternary1" plots the data distribution in barycentric coordinates. "ternary2" maps these coordinates spatially.
\item \strong{Small Multiples:} Best for inspecting the spatial distribution of every single class individually.
\item \strong{Dominant:} Provides a "hard" classification map but retains information about uncertainty via transparency (alpha).
